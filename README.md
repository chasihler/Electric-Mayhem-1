# Electric Mayhem 1
 EM SRS Roboton Robot 

 by Charles Ihler

 This robot's inspiration is to deviate from the expensive builds of PopBot and provide a solution that is affordable to "scrap" together.

 Target: SAMD51 Controllers on CAN "RoboBus" (RoboBu design by Greg S of Snohomish County Robotics Group). 

 Initial version is on 15mm extrusion frame w/ 3D printed sub structure. 
 Locomotion is 2x hoverboard hub motors.
